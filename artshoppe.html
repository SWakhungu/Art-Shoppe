            <p>Let us get acquainted. My name is Steve Wakhungu. The Art Shoppe as you may have figured out already, is an online art shop where I showcase some of my artworks. Why some and not all, you may ask? Well, as they say, the beautiful ones are not yet born. Artistically, the better art pieces are yet to be drawn. When they are, without a doubt they will grace this page too.</p>

        <div class="sidebar right">
            Well, how do you stand to benefit now that you are here?          
            Admit it; you love art and are not necessarily a connoisseur. I'd be happy to provide your space with affordable pieces. Go on. Order one.
