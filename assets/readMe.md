# The Art Shoppe Website
This project combines knowledge of front-end technologies i.e. HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript to build an app that enables the visitors/users to order for art pieces displayed in a grid format.
## Technologies used
1. HTML5
2. CSS3
3. JavaScript

## Installation process
Clone the project to your local using the git clone command `git clone <repository-url>`.
Navigate to the appropriate directory on your local repository using the `cd` command in the interface and use `code .` command to open the VS Code editor, from where you will work on the files. There will be three files for the project in the 'repository-url' thus copied that will need to be created - html file, style.css file, and a script.js file.
Always check the status of the working directory using `git status`, add files using `git add 'file name'`, and practice good version control by commiting frequently with `git commit -m "Message"`.
